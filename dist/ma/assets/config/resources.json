      "summary": "Medication adherence is the process by which patients take their medicine as prescribed by their health care provider. Nonadherence may be associated with greater mortality risk, increased hospitalizations, and increased costs. This presentation reviews various barriers to adherence, discusses tools to measure adherence, and explores various strategies that may help improve adherence, including patient reminders and education and various patient-centered communication strategies. The presentation aims to highlight that medication adherence is an important issue that may be impacted by all members of the care team.",

Ways to identify high-quality research evidence are discussed. Although some argue that EBM may only be practiced by academicians, this presentation aims to dispel this myth. The presenter walks the audience through an example of the critical process of EBM and suggests some strategies for its application at the patient level.",

      "summary": "Using knowledge of the principles of pharmacology in everyday practice may help clinicians maximize the efficacy and safety of drug therapies. This presentation provides an overview of principles of PK and PD, and explores how the effects of drugs are influenced by drug-associated factors and patient characteristics. The presenter reviews 4 key criteria that influence drug levels and kinetics in the body, speci$cally absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. A deeper understanding of these concepts may help clinicians prescribe an appropriate therapeutic treatment regimen and reduce the possibility of adverse e!ects. Examples of drug-related factors and patient characteristics that impact PK and PD are emphasized.",

      "summary": "Drug development, from early discovery to regulatory approval for marketing, involves a long, complicated process. The process is complex, expensive, and has a low likelihood of eventual success. Completing this development process takes more than 10 years and involves collaboration among industry scientists, academic researchers, and clinicians. This presentation reviews the work involved at each stage of the drug discovery and development process and describes several challenges faced when bringing a medication from the chemist’s bench to the patient’s bedside. Recent changes in diagnostics, therapeutics, and drug development, along with rapid advancements in areas such as biologics, biosimilars, and nanotechnology, are likely to shape future clinical research and treatments.",

      "summary": "Historically, diversity has not always been considered in clinical trials but ignoring diversity may contribute to missed opportunities to fully understand the factors that lead to disease or good health outcomes. Diversity in clinical trials may provide results that are more generalizable, reduce disparities in health outcomes, and optimize treatment based on individual differences. This presentation will explore barriers to the inclusion of patients from underrepresented groups in clinical trials, including patient barriers, HCP-related barriers, and barriers resulting from the clinical trial itself. The presenter will explore several strategies that may be used to help promote diversity in clinical trials.",

      "summary": "To read and evaluate medical research, clinicians need to be able to understand basic statistical concepts (eg, statistical and clinical significance, risks and odds ratios, and number needed to treat) and apply them appropriately to clinical studies. This presentation begins with illustrations to help clinicians better understand what is meant by statistical and clinical significance. Absolute and relative risks, odds and odds ratios, and number needed to treat are then defined and illustrated with nonmedical and medical examples. The presentation concludes with a discussion of the criteria used to discriminate causation vs association in clinical research. Together, these explanations and examples may help clinicians interpret research findings and apply them to clinical practice. A background in statistical concepts and terminology is not needed.",

      "summary": "Patient engagement is a concept that combines a patient’s knowledge, skills, ability, and willingness to manage their own health and to improve health care. Although clinical trials are critical to advance health and patient participation is essential, the patient perspective is rarely considered. Patients can provide valuable insights across the clinical trial continuum and help support more efficient trials with better recruitment and retention, and more impactful outcomes. This presentation will explore opportunities to better engage patients in clinical trials. The presenter will discuss approaches to address patient barriers to trial participation, highlight the importance of physician involvement, and review recruitment and retention strategies. The involvement of patient groups and the commitment by regulatory agencies is expected help facilitate patient engagement in clinical trials.",

      "summary": "Biomarkers may be used throughout the patient journey to aid in diagnosis, monitoring, prediction of treatment response, and monitoring of safety and risk. Biomarkers also aid research and inform new drug development. This presentation will provide multiple examples of how different biomarkers may be used in research, clinical practice, and drug development. It will describe various methodologies for measuring biomarkers and provide an overview of how biomarker tests are regulated to ensure that the tests are “fit for purpose” and improve patient outcomes.",

      "summary": "Vaccines have contributed to global health and have prevented more than 100 million cases of serious communicable diseases in the United States since 1924. Vaccines are complex entities, both in terms of their components and the technology required to produce them. This presentation provides examples of the effect of vaccines on public health, reviews key elements of the host immune system and how vaccines help to protect against disease, and discusses the complex processes and ongoing safety monitoring involved in vaccine development. The presenter also discusses how, despite guidelines for vaccine administration, attaining high vaccination coverage is an ongoing challenge, in part, due to vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy is the delayed acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite their availability. The presenter will review various communication strategies to address vaccine hesitancy, enhance communication, and reinforce vaccination needs.",

CER is the use of evidence to directly compare two or more interventions and strategies to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor health conditions. This presentation reviews the types of data used in CER and explores the strengths and weaknesses of different types of studies. Each decision maker must consider the relevance and credibility of the available evidence. The presenter will review the questions that should be considered when evaluating relevance and credibility. CER will continue to play an important role in determining what works best for patients in the future.",

      "summary": "Social determinants of health (SDoH) are the non-medical factors that influence health outcomes. When SDoH negatively impact health outcomes, they may create health disparities among racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. To achieve health equity – where everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be healthy – it is important to address the SDoH that contribute to health and health care disparities. In this presentation, SDoH and their relationship to health disparities and health equity are reviewed. Furthermore, opportunities to achieve health equity through education, collaboration, research, and advocacy are presented.",
